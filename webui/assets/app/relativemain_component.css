/* This file is for any specific, non-color, non-layout styles unique to the
   root element of RelativeMain.vue ('.relative-main-content-wrapper').
   For example, a unique border-radius or a subtle box-shadow if it's
   not part of a global card style.
   If no such styles are needed, this file can remain empty or the @import removed.
