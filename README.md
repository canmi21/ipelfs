## IPELFS

IPELFS is a file system with more flexible backup configurations than RAID, allowing fine-grained control over the importance level of each file. It provides a complete API for cloud-based interactions and includes database-like features. As a static file index system, it enables using the file system as a database through API calls. The backend is built in Rust for high I/O performance and uses the Axum framework to support asynchronous operations. The frontend is built with Vue and supports Socket connections to the backend. Future releases will include a cross-platform client and full browser-based FS management features.
